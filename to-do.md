TO DO -- SP13 design analysis
============================

bfda_sp13
---------

- State B=10000 in the intro!
- Make up our mind about Chen et al's guidelines vs formula - leave only corresponding simulations

reanalysis_original
-------------------

- Section on effect size - say in what sense this is small
- Present brms model first and its interpretation first; then lme4 as a sanity check
- Remove 2x4 ANOVA analysis from re-analysis script (to make it less cumbersome)
- Does the interaction effect appear when just looking at shift errors?
