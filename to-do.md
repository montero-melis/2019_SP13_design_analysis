TO DO -- SP13 design analysis
============================

bfda_sp13
---------

- Run all simulations with B = 10000
- Add simulation with t-test + d=0.4

reanalysys_original
-------------------

- Present t-test analysis first, eta-squared to d conversion later
- Remove 2x4 ANOVA analysis from re-analysis script (to make it less cumbersome)
