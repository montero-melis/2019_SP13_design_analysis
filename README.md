2019_SP13_design_analysis
===========================

Bayes factor design analysis for replication of Shebani and Pulverm√ºller (2013)

NB:

The script `reanalysis_original.Rmd` won't run if you clone the
repository from git, because the file with the data from the original study
is missing. This is because we agreed with the authors not to publicly share
their data. In August 2019, they informed us that they would soon upload the
data and make it publicly available.
